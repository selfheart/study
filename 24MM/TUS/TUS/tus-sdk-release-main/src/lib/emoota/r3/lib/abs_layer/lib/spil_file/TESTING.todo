- Tests which rely on `system(3posix)` should be conditionally
  included, and source for those tests should be seperated away from
  platform agnostic tests.

- Tests should NOT depend on previous tests succeeded, or even have
  run.  E.g. Test2 should not use data created by Test1.

- Tests should utilize group & function setup/teardown hooks to
  establish pre-conditions for tests.  Specificially we should not
  rely on the build system to construct directories and files used in
  tests.
